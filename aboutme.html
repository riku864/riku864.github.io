        <h2>My Experiences</h2>
        <p>Whenever I was able to get my hands on any device I would try and dig deep into all the advanced tech that's
            inside and learn it all. My father would be a big factor of my life when it comes to technology. The
            interesting thing about technology is that I was able to share this bond with my father, as he was able to
            share information about certain things when I didn't know what they were. He was able to provide a lot when
            it came to technology, teaching me a lot and further expanding my interest in the IT field. As I've grown
            older, I took my interest in technology and put it into action. Modifying technology that I had access to at
            the time such as a MacBook Pro 2017.</p>
        <p>For things I've done outside of IT, I usually enjoy playing video games or hanging out with friends. When it
            comes to playing video games, I particularly enjoy playing competitively and have actively participated in
            E-Sports. E-Sports has been a significant part of my life that has given me a lot of joy, lots of new
            experiences, and people that I've met. Some of my teammates from the same club are some of my closest
            friends today. We hang out a lot and we spend a lot of time together as a group, and it really helps me live
            my life to the fullest.</p>
