            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Riku, I come from Japan as a foreigner who has lived in America for 6 years now. I've been
                interested in the IT industry for many years ever since I was a little kid. Most of my life, I've been
                surrounded by electronics and devices all thanks to my father. Since I was so interested in electronics
                my
                whole life, I wanted to take action on what I could do with it. And I was given the opportunity to join
                the
                career tech program for IT, I took it and made the most of what information was given to me.</p>
